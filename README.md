# Wildfire Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a **Wildfire Prediction** model using **SAResNet** and **ConvLSTM** architectures. The project leverages PyTorch, ResNet, and ConvLSTM to analyze wildfire risk based on environmental data.

## Features

- **ResNet Backbone**: Utilizes a ResNet-based CNN architecture for feature extraction.
- **ConvLSTM Integration**: Captures spatiotemporal relationships for accurate wildfire prediction.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bin447/Wildfire-Predict.git
cd Wildfire-Predict
pip install -r requirements.txt
